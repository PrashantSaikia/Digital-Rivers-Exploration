I came across a problem from the 1999 British Informatics Olympiad called Digital Rivers. It is the sequence where the next number is given by the previous number + the sum of the digits of the previous number.

For some reason, the sequence appeared quite interesting to me, and so I researched it on the web. I was surprised that I could find hardly anything at all about analysis of this sequence. So, I decided to explore it in more depth.

Some of these patterns remind me of the logistic map and the Feigenbaum constant. Specifically:
- the period doubling patterns in the logistic map look kinda similar to how digital rivers bifurcate into two for sufficiently large values.
- the difference of digital rivers gives fractal-like patterns, just like how the period doubling bifurcations give rise to fractal-like patterns beyond r=3.57 in the logistic map.
- the modulus of river sequences are uniform at some values and random at others, just like how the equilibrium population in the logistic map is random for most inputs but uniform for a few.
